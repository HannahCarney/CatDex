## Challenges

I was tasked with designing this app myself, and gave myself three days for this project. Edit cats proved to be a very complex UX journey that I was unable to complete within in allotted three days. Many UX problems occured when adding functionality for delete cat - namely needing an empty state for no cats. 

## Code - interesting bits

I designed CatDex to be dynamic. In catJson.js I created the key:
```ruby
fieldTypes: ['name', 'breed', 'description']
```
This field can be edited easily to remove a key from both the list of cats on the home page, and the form to add cats. This was done to quickly add and remove fields to play with the design. Have a go!
