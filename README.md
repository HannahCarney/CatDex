## Challenges

I was tasked with designing this app myself, and gave myself three days for this project. Many UX problems occured when adding functionality for delete cat - namely needing an empty state for no cats as well as a confirmation message. Edit cats was a bigger problem - I designed an additional button on the Home page, which triggered the ability to edit the text, which turned the edit button into a tick mark for "saving." However, this opened up the UX design problem that more than one cat could be edited at a time. I spent a lot of time thinking through the problem, but it proved to be complex. A possible solution is to design a new page in which to display the cat info upon click, but I ultimetly ran out of time to design such a page. At a later date I hope the add that functionality, and am open to suggestions!

## Code - interesting bits

I designed CatDex to be dynamic. In catJson.js I created the key:
```ruby
fieldTypes: ['name', 'breed', 'description']
```
This field can be edited easily to remove a key from both the list of cats on the home page, and the form to add cats. This was done to quickly add and remove fields to play with the design. Have a go!
