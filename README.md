## Challenges

I was tasked with designing this app myself, and gave myself three days for this project. When adding the list cat functionlity, I realised that the app looked boring without pictures. This led to me researching cat picture APIs in order to pull in a fun picture to make the design more exciting. Many UX problems occured when adding functionality for delete cat - namely needing an empty state for no cats as well as a confirmation message. Edit cats was a bigger problem - I designed an additional button on the Home page, which triggered the ability to edit the text, which turned the edit button into a tick mark for "saving." However, this opened up the UX design problem that more than one cat could be edited at a time. I spent a lot of time thinking through the design problem, but it proved to be complex. A possible solution is to design a new page in which to display the cat info upon click, but I ultimetly ran out of time to design such a page. At a later date I hope to add that functionality, and am open to suggestions!

## What I learnt

Mostly that UX design is really hard! From a code perspective - I had a play with redux-form which I had never used before but have always wanted to try. It was fun to learn, but then I realised that the UX possibly didn't even need the cat form to persist through redux. Still working on my UX knowledge I suppose!

## Code - interesting bits

I designed CatDex to be dynamic. In catJson.js I created the key:
```ruby
fieldTypes: ['name', 'breed', 'description']
```
This field can be edited easily to remove a key from both the list of cats on the home page, and the form to add cats. This was done to quickly add and remove fields to play with the design. Have a go!
